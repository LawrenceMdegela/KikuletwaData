The project presents data for river levels measured at multiple locations along the Kikuletwa river in northern Tanzania using ultrasound sensors. The goal is to contribute to reducing the data scarcity problem and enhance the development of more accurate flood prediction models. By expanding the ground truth of the river, this project will provide valuable information to policy makers on water use, leading to more informed decisions and better management of water resources. With accurate and up-to-date information on river levels, communities along the river can better prepare for flooding events and mitigate their impacts.
